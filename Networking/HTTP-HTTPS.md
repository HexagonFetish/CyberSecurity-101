## HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is the protocol that provides the rules for how data will be exchanged between servers and users on the internet. <br> <br>

There are status codes, these can be listed as: **200, 201, 301, 403, 500**. <br> <br>

HTTP is a truly disgraceful protocol, it has neither security nor good. This is as bad as UDP. <br> <br>

Passwords and credit cards are kept in plain text.

## HTTP(S) (s for secure)

This is http but it is the secure version. The letter S comes from secure. If you have an SSL certificate, security is provided with the TLS protocol.
<br> <br> Your passwords are encrypted and secured.
